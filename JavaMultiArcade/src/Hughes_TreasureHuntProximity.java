/**
 * TreasureHuntProximity
 * This program is the main file for the proximity tracker version of TreasureHunt速. It functions almost exactly the same as
 * TreasureHunt速, except for -REDACTED-. It's definitely more exciting than the other version, although due to company-wide
 * Intellectual Property classifications, nobody really knows for sure if these two games are really any different. Upon
 * "hacking the mainframe" it was determined that missed guesses are marked with a rough estimate of how far you were from
 * the treasure in this version, whereas the other marked it with an X. But I mean, come on. Who would chose to play this
 * game instead of MineSweeper速?? Who is even going to read this comment? Likely nobody. Anyways, enjoy your "fun" game of
 * TreasureHunt: Proximity Edition速
